## Setting up Mist


### Dependencies

* `Node.js` v7.x (use the prefered installation method for your OS)
* `Meteor` javascript app framework
* `Yarn` package manager
* `Electron` v1.4.15 cross platform desktop app framework
* `Gulp` build and automation system

```
$ curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
$ curl -o- -L https://yarnpkg.com/install.sh | bash
$ yarn global add electron@1.4.15
$ yarn global add gulp
```

### Mist setup

Now you're ready to initialize Mist for development:

```
$ cd ~/Desktop
$ mkdir mist_test
# cd mist_test
$ git clone https://github.com/ethereum/mist.git
$ cd mist
$ yarn
$ cd interface && meteor --no-release-check
```
While meteor is running open another terminal window and go back to the folder you created `/Desktop/mist_test/mist`

Now lets run electron for the first time:

```
$ cd ~/Desktop/mist_test/mist
$ yarn dev:electron
```

* Launch the application in test network
* Wait for past blocks to download
* Write down your ethereum address (we need this later)
* `0x6a6401AEb4a3beb93820904E761b0d86364bb39E` 
* This is my test ethereum wallet, every time you see this wallet in my code you should replace this with your wallet

### Were done with mist!

If you want to read more about mist [you can do so here.](https://github.com/ethereum/mist "Ethereum's github") For now close both terminals. The one running meteor and the one running mist/electron.
* Make sure to close both terminals

# Truffle setup

Lets install truffle and get testrpc

* `$ npm install -g truffle`
* `$ npm install -g ethereumjs-testrpc`

Now we can go ahead and start a truffle app

* `$ cd ~/Desktop`
* `$ mkdir truftest`
* `$ cd truftest`
* `$ truffle unbox react`

So we can start the servers

* `$ testrpc`

in another terminal go into your truffle folder
* `$ cd ~/Desktop/truftest`
* `$ truffle compile`
* `$ truffle migrate`
* `$ npm start`

Now we can play with the solidity and react on the site.

# Free Rinkeby ether
In order to use the test network we have to have test ether which we cant just print out. 

* Log into `github`, create an account if you dont have one
* Head to [https://gist.github.com/](https://gist.github.com/)
* Create a new public gist and only write put your ethereum address in there
* [Check out my example](https://gist.github.com/alaingoldman/6fe77a7a71b6c706ab31f2512247d870)
* [Get free Ether from https://faucet.rinkeby.io/](https://faucet.rinkeby.io/)
* Paste the url from the gist file into the faucet page



# Connecting to Rinkeby 

Make sure to close the terminal 

First, start geth with Rinkeby and make sure that the correct APIs for Truffle are enabled.
```
$ geth --rinkeby --rpc --rpcapi db,eth,net,web3,personal --unlock="0x6a6401AEb4a3beb93820904E761b0d86364bb39E" --rpccorsdomain http://localhost:3000
```
Please dont forget to replace my wallet with the wallet you got from mist/electron.

This will ask you for the password you gave mist/electron.

Next, we need to add Rinkeby to our truffle config file. If we open `truffle.js` in our contract code weâ€™ll see something like:

```
module.exports = {
  rpc: {
    host: 'localhost',
    port: '8545'
 },
  networks: {
    development: {
      host: "localhost",
      port: 8545,
      network_id: "*" // Match any network id
    },
    rinkeby: {
      host: "localhost", // Connect to geth on the specified
      port: 8545,
      from: "0x6a6401AEb4a3beb93820904E761b0d86364bb39E", // default address to use for any transaction Truffle makes during migrations
      network_id: 4,
      gas: 4612388 // Gas limit used for deploys
    }
  },
};
```
Now we just have to migrate the contract onto rinkeby. This is going to ask for the password you gave mist/electron.
```
$ truffle migrate --network rinkeby
```
If you want to view the current state of your contracts on rinkeby test network go to this url. 

Replace my wallet with yours. [My address's transactions.](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x6a6401aeb4a3beb93820904e761b0d86364bb39e)
```
https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/YOUR-WALLET-HERE
```

Now we can turn on the server and we're done
```
$ npm start 
```
