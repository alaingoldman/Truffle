## Setting up Mist


### Dependencies

* `Node.js` v7.x (use the prefered installation method for your OS)
* `Meteor` javascript app framework
* `Yarn` package manager
* `Electron` v1.4.15 cross platform desktop app framework
* `Gulp` build and automation system

```
$ curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
$ curl -o- -L https://yarnpkg.com/install.sh | bash
$ yarn global add electron@1.4.15
$ yarn global add gulp
```

### Mist setup

Now you're ready to initialize Mist for development:

```
$ cd ~/Desktop
$ mkdir mist_test
# cd mist_test
$ git clone https://github.com/ethereum/mist.git
$ cd mist
$ yarn
$ cd interface && meteor --no-release-check
```
While meteor is running open another terminal window and go back to the folder you created `/Desktop/mist_test/mist`

Now lets run electron for the first time:

```
$ cd ~/Desktop/mist_test/mist
$ yarn dev:electron
```

* Launch the application in test network
* Wait for past blocks to download
* Write down your ethereum address (we need this later)

### Were done with mist!

If you want to read more about mist [you can do so here.](https://github.com/ethereum/mist "Ethereum's github") For now close both terminals. The one running meteor and the one running mist/electron.
* make sure to close both terminals

# truffle setup

Let install truffle and get testrpc

* `$ npm install -g truffle`
* `$ npm install -g ethereumjs-testrpc`

Now we can go ahead and start a truffle app

* `$ cd ~/Desktop`
* `$ mkdir truftest`
* `$ cd truftest`
* `$ truffle unbox react`

So we can start the servers

* `$ testrpc`
in another terminal go into your truffle folder
* `$ cd ~/Desktop/truftest`
* `$ truffle migrate`
* `$ npm start`
